## Understanding the TS compiler

The Typescript compiler warns you about errors about your code but continues to compile it nonetheless to give you a chance to run your code in case it is not a real error (i.e. your code still works after it is compiled).

 This behaviour can be suppressed via the compiler options in tsconfig.json.

 ```json
 {
     "compilerOptions": {
         "module": "commonjs",
         "target": "es5",
         "noImplicitAny": false,
         "sourceMap": false
     },
     "exclude": [
         "node_modules"
     ]
 }
 ```
